-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=gray-living-room-with-pops-of-pattern-and-color-gray-walls-and-sofas>Gray Living Room With Pops Of Pattern And Color.
