While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=the-visual-exegesis-iron-man-amp-captain-america-no-72>The Visual Exegesis: Iron Man & Captain America, No. 72<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-visual-exegesis-iron-man-amp-captain-america-no-72>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iyTL5apVPW4/TZGH7vounLI/AAAAAAAAAI4/ThQ2vWQ6aHg/s1600/Iron+Man+and+Captain+America+72+-+p1.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.3iC_z_dmMYJupZnzkR9zSgHaK6&pid=15.1"' alt="The Visual Exegesis: Iron Man & Captain America, No. 72"><p><em>Source: thevisualexegesis.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>captain iron america man.</p></blockquote><p>The Best Way to Store Wallpapers: A Storage Solution for Your Collection
